    				<h3>Hello!</h3>
    				<p>Welcome to the first CookIt Media newsletter! Because there’s never enough time in any given day to pick up the phone and chat with all of you, and because we really want to keep you up to speed on what we’ve been up to, we settled on the idea of a newsletter. In addition to updates from the CookIt frontlines, we’ll share news about our community, tips for growing your brand, ideas to help you win at social and more monthly. <br> Plus the occasional and probably embarrassing behind-the-scenes photo. <br><br>
    									Let us know what you think! And thanks for reading, Laurie <br><br>
    									<b>P.S. Did you see our fancy new website? Thanks Emma and Nicole for the vision and the hard work.</b></p>

							<br><br>
							Over in the CookIt Content Studio, we’ve gathered up a group of some of the most creative, talented folks we know. Here’s a look at what they can do:

    			<p>4 Questions to Ask Yourself</p>
    		</div>
    		<p>What makes your brand unique? How does it stand out from your competitors? If those questions give you pause, it’s time to create a positioning statement! That is, a concise statement that clarifies who you are and how the content you create benefits your reader.
    			<br>
    			Establishing your competition—those brands, blogs and sites that own a corner of the content world you live in—is a big part of this. When you zero in on what differentiates your brand, you’ll see the “gap” in the marketplace—the opportunity that’s all yours for the taking.
    			<br>
    		Intrigued? Jumpstart your brainstorming session with the four questions below. Then join us for the most recent episode of Marly McMillen’s inspiring Chopped podcast, where we talk in depth about—you guessed it—brand positioning!

    				<span>Five questions for renae</span>
    			</div>
    			<div class="questions">
    				<p>
    					Q: If you had to pick one: Martha or Ina? <br>
    					A: Ina, forever and always. I watched an obscene amount of Barefoot Contessa reruns in college, when I was also starting to cook for myself. Ina walked me through a lot of dishes I wouldn't have otherwise attempted, like roast chicken and ratatouille. I give her a lot of the credit for turning me into a serious home cook—and for my obsession with "barn" kitchens.
    					<br><br>
    					Q: Favorite coffee bar in LA? <br>
    					A: Eightfold Coffee in Echo Park, for a serious cup of coffee and for the Nutella croissants! <br><br>
    					Q: Most-used app on your phone?<br>
    					A: I wish I had a unique answer, but it's definitely Instagram.
    					<br><br>
    					Q: The one dish you can’t cook? <br>
    					A: Rice! I know that sounds crazy, but my husband grew up in a Persian family. They have very exacting standards for the preparation of basmati rice, and I still don't think I've nailed the technique.  <br><br>
    					Q: Most amazing meal you’ve ever had? <br>
    					A: Assisi, Italy circa 2006. Spaghetti bolognese. Mozzarella with the freshest, punchiest tomatoes. Lots and lots of prosciutto.
